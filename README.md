1.	Introduction:
NetStumbler is a popular Windows tool used to discover wireless networks. It scans your surroundings for available Wi-Fi networks and provides detailed information such as signal strength, encryption status, channel and more. Originally designed for Windows XP and 2000, this tool has become a valuable tool for both general users and network administrators.
The main purpose of NetStumbler is to help users find and connect to wireless networks. You can use it to troubleshoot network connectivity issues, optimize network performance, and secure your wireless network by identifying unauthorized access points. However, advances in wireless technology and the availability of more sophisticated devices have reduced its effectiveness over the years.
Despite its limitations, NetStumbler is still a useful tool for basic Wi-Fi network discovery and analysis, especially for users running older Windows operating systems.

2.	Features/Characteristics:
Network discovery: NetStumbler scans nearby wireless networks and displays important information such as SSID, signal strength, channel and encryption status.
Signal Strength: Provides real-time signal strength measurements and helps users identify areas with weak or strong Wi-Fi signals.
Graphical Display: This tool displays network information in a user-friendly graphical interface for easy understanding and interpretation.
Network Mapping: Users can create maps of wireless networks to visualize distribution and coverage areas.
SSID detection: NetStumbler detects hidden SSIDs and shows networks that don't broadcast their names.
Network Security: Although NetStumbler is not a security tool itself, it can help you identify rogue or rogue access points and improve your network security.

3.	Methodology:
Investigated Netstumbler as an application for encryptyion, SSID detection, wireless networking, scanning and security.
Because the software is outdated we have thoroughly discovered the features.
SSID detection by running the software and using active scan. The broadcasting signals provide an easy means to discover neighbouring networks.
Wireless Communication- In this, the netstumbler provides parameter values based on the network like signal strength, channel, MAC Address, vendor name, etc. which expose network details.
War driving- use the apllication to actually scan vulnerable access points that can be used to steal and reveal identity over the network.
Signal strength- Uses data to know the signal strength of the network and help in visualization of the data using netstumbler.
Encryption- It is also used to implement various encryption algorithms and help secure packets on a network.

5.	Results:
NetStumbler uses passive scanning technology to discover wireless networks. An outline of the methodology is as follows.

Select Interface: NetStumbler allows users to select the wireless network interface to scan. This can be an internal Wi-Fi card or an external USB Wi-Fi adapter.

Scan: After selecting an interface, NetStumbler starts scanning for nearby wireless networks. Discover your network by listening to beacon frames sent by nearby access points.

Network detection: When a beacon frame is detected, NetStumbler extracts information such as SSID (network name), signal strength (RSSI), channel, encryption status and other network parameters.

Data display: NetStumbler displays this information in an easy-to-use graphical interface that allows users to view a list of detected networks and their properties.

User interaction: Users can interact with the software by selecting networks, viewing detailed information, and accessing additional features such as mapping and logging.

Channel scanning: NetStumbler scans different Wi-Fi channels to discover networks operating on different frequencies. This helps users identify the best channel for their network and avoid interference.

Logging and Mapping: NetStumbler can log detected networks and their characteristics and create maps of network coverage areas based on signal strength measurements.

SSID detection: NetStumbler can detect hidden SSIDs by passively listening to probe request frames sent by clients trying to connect to the hidden network.

In general, the NetStumbler method revolves around passive scanning, extracting network parameters and user-friendly display of Wi-Fi network information.

5.	Conclusion:
Although we tried implementing the application, it was outdated and was not able to run. However we did explore some of the basic features of netstumbler and use them know basics of network security.
